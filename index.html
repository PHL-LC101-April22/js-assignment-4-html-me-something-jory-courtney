         <h1 id= "How I almost ran into Mr. Valentino">How I almost ran into Valentino Garavani in Capri, Italy</h1>
            </header>
         <p>In my many travels across the world, one never knows what amazing experiences or treasures await. Of course, there will always be gift shops to collect assorted trinkets (my favorite thing to collect are shot glasses. I've amassed quite a fun collection), and always plenty of restaurants to truly taste the surrounding culture, and even different currencies: &cent; &pound; <b>&euro;</b>. However, it's truly a <b><em>*magical*</em></b> feeling when you run into a celebrity, or even feel the proximity to one, whether by <b>space</b>, <b>location</b>, <b>time</b>, or by a <b>combination</b> of those elements. So in my HTML editorial debut, I will be sharing the story of how the legendary designer and fashion <i>ICON</i>, Valentino Garavani (Maison Valentino), and myself were <sup><b>*this*</b></sup> close to crossing paths on my vaction to the Amalfi Coast in Italy.</p>

            <h2 id= "The Amalfi Coast">The Amalfi Coast</h2>
            <p>I'd first love to paint a picture of the Amalfi Coast, for those who are unfamiliar. Wikipedia describes the Amalfi Coast as:</p> 
            <blockquote cite = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalfi_Coast">'a stretch of coastline in southern Italy overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Gulf of Salerno'.</blockquote> <p>It has a beautiful Medditerranean climate, very mountanious, and in fact, the villa we stayed in was on the cliff. And we had beautiful views down to the <b>Marina Piccola</b>. The Amalfi Coast boasts some of the worlds some beautiful towns/islands, such as, <b>Positano</b>, <b>Sorrento</b>, <b>Furore</b>, <b>Amalfi</b>, and <b>Capri</b>. For this story we will be focusing on Capri, which is a stand alone island right off the coast, but click <a href="https://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions-/amalfi-coast-positano-amalfi-salerno-i-cm-ac.htm">here</a> for a cool article about top attractions and places to visit in the Amalfi Coast. Capri has two main marinas positioned on opposite sides for people to access the island. The first and primary Marina is <b>Marina Grande</b> and as I stated before, the other is <b>Marina Piccola</b>. Our villa was situated on the Piccola side.    </p>

            <p>Now imagine, my friends and I are enjoying a lovely afternoon on our patio that overlooks Marina Piccola, and what do we see?</p> <img src = "images\IMG_7842.jpg" alt = "Yatch's in Marina Piccola">
               <p>Now, under first glance, we all were shocked and amazed to see so many yatchs. We all thought it clearly had to be someone of great importance because there were so many yatchs and at certain points, they would connect together and you could see people walking from one boat to the other. But it wasn't until the next day while having lunch at a restaurant called, "La Canzone del Mare", that we realized Mr. Valentino himself had been celebrating his <b><em>87th</em></b> birthday at our Marina, via his Instagram.</p> <img src = "images\image3.png" alt = "Mr. Valentino instagram birthday post" >
               <p>And to make the experience even more exciting, we later found out he had a celebratory meal at the same restaurant we were now sitting in.</p> <img src = "images\image4.png" alt = "Valentino instagram post of 'La Canzone del Mare'"> <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxU1g-EhK2B/">View original post here</a></p>
               <p>If you look in the right space of the photo above, you can see a rock platform connected to the restaurant. In the photo below, you can see me visiting that exact location I ventured onto. And if you also look in the comments portion of the photo above, you can see my friend Melinda (<b>@melindaferry</b>) actually commented on his photo that we ate at that restaurant, along with my reply (<b>@joryluvslife</b>).</p> <img src = "images\IMG_7855.jpg" alt = "Me at La Canzone Del Mare" >
               <p>And that's the story of how my friends and I <b>*almost*</b> ran into the legendary Mr. Valentino.
